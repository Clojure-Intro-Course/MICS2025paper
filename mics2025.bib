abstract = {Programmatic errors are often difficult to resolve due to poor usability of error messages. Applying theories of visual perception and techniques in visual design, we created three visual variants of a representative error message in a modern UI framework. In an online experiment, we found that the visual variants led to substantial improvements over the original error message in both error comprehension and resolution. Our results demonstrate that seemingly cosmetic changes to the presentation of an error message can have an oversized impact on its usability.},

abstract = {Error messages are one of the most important tools that a language offers its programmers. For novices, this feed-back is especially critical. Error messages typically contain both a textual description of the problem and an indication of where in the code the error occurred. This paper reports on a series of studies that explore beginning students' inter-actions with the vocabulary and source-expression high-lighting in DrRacket. Our findings demonstrate that the error message significantly fail to convey information accurately to students, while also suggesting alternative designs that might address these problems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a lightweight process to guide error report authoring. We take the perspective that error reports are really classifiers of program information. They should therefore be subjected to the same measures as other classifiers (e.g., precision and recall). We formalize this perspective as a process for assessing error reports, describe our application of this process to an actual programming language, and present a preliminary study on the utility of the resulting error reports.},
