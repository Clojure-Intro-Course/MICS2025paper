% This is sigproc-sp.tex -FILE FOR V2.6SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% OCTOBER 2002
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V2.6SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% 
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.6SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
%
%  However, both the CopyrightYear (default to 2002) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (default to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX) can still be over-ridden by whatever the author
% inserts into the source .tex file.
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2003} will cause 2003 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
%
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide

The Clojure programming language, built on the Java Virtual Machine, is a widely used functional language. Its simple syntax makes it a powerful language to introduce beginner programmers to key concepts of programming. However, debugging in Clojure can be unintuitive because Clojure errors are exceptions in the underlying Java language. They frequently contain terminology intended for experienced developers, leaving out important context. As a result, what would otherwise be a powerful educational tool presents a difficult learning curve for new programmers.

In this paper we discuss the structure of Clojure error messages, explain the data flow for the error messages processing, and the chosen data representation. We outline options for formatting the error messages to beginners, as well as the principles that guide our choices. We present design examples of views and interactions for a variety of error messages. We conclude with a discussion of key open questions and future directions.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

As an example of one such mistake, a novice to Clojure might write an expression like
\begin{verbatim}
(filter neg? 1 -1 0)
\end{verbatim}
instead of a correct application to a vector:
\begin{verbatim}
(filter neg? [1 -1 0])
\end{verbatim}
 Clojure presents this error as an {\it ArityException}, referring to the number of arguments of the function. The message is cryptic for beginners, especially without the documentation.

\section{Babel project}\label{sec:babel}

Our research project, Babel, aims to provide beginner programmers with a tool that replaces Clojure error messages with clearer explanations, removing unfamiliar jargon.

Our previous versions of Babel transformed error messages into a beginner-friendly format by taking an exception object and producing a plaintext description of the issue. It employs a Clojure feature called spec that provides a way to specify the number and types of arguments allowed for a function. Unlike default error messages, spec allows us to display the erroneous code and the specific argument that violates the requirements. Using spec, the error message above is presented as: 
\begin{verbatim}
(filter neg? 1 -1 0)
\end{verbatim}
``Wrong number of arguments in (filter neg? 1 -1 0): the function filter expects one or two arguments but was given four arguments.''

Our project currently includes specs for many core functions and also rewrites common non-spec errors. However, one ongoing problem is to display the improved error messages in an IDE or an interactive panel. 

Our project poses the following core research question: ``How can we design error message presentation and interactions to help beginners fix errors in their programs?'' Exploring this question requires having a robust environment for experimenting with interactive error messages.

\section{Adding visual interactive environment}\label{sec:current}
Our goal is to improve the user experience by using Morse, a third-party viewer, to present error information in a more beginner-friendly format. For instance, visual cues will help distinguish between code and values, which are indistinguishable by default. Babel will also adjust the level of detail based on context, for example, displaying only relevant parts of a stack trace. Babel will also provide links to Clojure documentation where applicable.
